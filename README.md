# django-recipe-app

This Recipe app backend is written in popular python web framework called Django.

This recipe app provides us the list of recipes. We can read them and access them orwe can also mark them sas favorite so we doesn't need to be worried that a recipe is gone or anything like that.

In this project I have used the core django principles like dealing with urls and views, configuring django admin panel, using models and registering them.
I also work with static files like css and images and used django html templating. I also used the class based views to implement them.
